## 📦 Usage in Projects

This library is **published on npm** under the name [`@luisalbertodev/my-design-system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@luisalbertodev/my-design-system) — **as a technical practice only**.
It is **not intended for production usage**, and no guarantees are provided for stability or updates.

Install (for demo/testing purposes only):

```bash
npm install @luisalbertodev/my-design-system
```

> ✅ Recommended usage: fork and adapt to your own design system needs.

Alternatively, you can consume it locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm link
```

## 📚 Folder Structure

Each component lives in its own folder under `src/`, and follows this structure:

```
/ComponentName
├── Component.tsx
├── Component.styled.ts
├── Component.types.ts
├── Component.unit.spec.tsx
├── Component.integration.spec.tsx
├── Component.architecture.md
└── index.ts
```

> Refer to [`docs/component-guidelines.md`](./docs/component-guidelines.md) for architectural rationale.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Testing is split into:

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E (via Playwright)
