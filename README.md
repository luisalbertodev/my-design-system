# 🧱 Learn Design System | React Boilerplate Design System

A modern component library built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Storybook** — focused on accessibility, composability, and developer experience.

> For technical decisions, architectural philosophy, and contributor onboarding, see [`docs/component-guidelines.md`](./docs/component-guidelines.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- **Node.js**: `v22.14.0`
- **npm**: `v10.9.2`

Set up your environment:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

---

### 2. Run Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Build a static version:

```bash
npm run build:storybook
```

---

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
npm run test              # all tests
npm run test:unit         # unit tests
npm run test:integration  # integration tests
npm run test:coverage     # full coverage report
```

## 📦 Usage in Projects

This library is not published on npm.

You can consume it via local linking:

```bash
npm run build
npm link
```

> Optionally, prepare for publishing by running `npm publish`.

## 📚 Folder Structure

Each component lives in its own folder under `src/`, and follows this structure:

```
/ComponentName
├── Component.tsx
├── Component.styled.ts
├── Component.types.ts
├── Component.unit.spec.tsx
├── Component.integration.spec.tsx
├── Component.architecture.md
└── index.ts
```

> Refer to [`docs/component-guidelines.md`](./docs/component-guidelines.md) for architectural rationale.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Testing is split into:

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E (via Playwright – WIP)

Run E2E (once implemented):

```bash
npx playwright test
```
